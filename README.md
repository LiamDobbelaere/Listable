# Listable
(previously ShiftUp) A todo list that's just a shortcut away! Best combined with a cloud storage folder.

This has a number of bugfixes and improvements since the last ShiftUp version.
The name change was necessary because it was moving out of alpha and the name no longer suited the inital shortcut used.

## Usage
* Download the latest binaries from LatestBinaries/Listable-latest.zip
* Extract somewhere on your computer (eg. C:\Listable)

* Click on the cogwheel and browse to a text file Listable can use to store your todo list (protip: pick a text file in your Dropbox/Google Drive/OneDrive folder)

* You can press Alt+Up at any time to unfold Listable, press escape or click away to hide it again
